Description
***********

``freckles`` is an application that downloads a remote code or data repository (a '*freckle*') that is structured according to one or some conventions. After download, ``freckles`` will execute pre-defined tasks appropriate for the type of *freckle* in question.

In order to handle those different data/code profiles, ``freckles`` can be extended with so called *adapters*. For example, if the `freckle` is a python project, ``freckles`` will use the ``python-dev`` adapter which will create a virtualenv (after, if necessary, downloading everything that is needed to create virtualenvs in the first place), download and install all dependencies it can find in any potential ``requirement_*.txt`` files, and then execute either ``pip install -e .`` or  ``python setup.py develop`` inside the created virtualenv.

Or, the `freckle` is a folder containing subfolders which in turn contain `dotfiles` (that's what configuration files are called in Unix-land). ``freckles`` will download this repo, install potentially configured applications that relate to the configuration files, and symbolically link those configuration files to the appropriate places.

Adapters (& profiles)
*********************

Overview
========

As *freckles* is designed to handle folders of data/code of different types, each using a different structure, it relies on plugins (called 'adapters') to process those different types of data (a data 'profile').

Currently, only very few types/profiles of data are 'officially' supported by *freckles*: :doc:`dotfiles </adapters/dotfiles>` and :doc:`python dev projects </adapters/python-dev>` (although, at the time you are reading this this might have changed). To encourage the creation of lots of *adapters* -- in order to support lots of different data *profiles* -- *freckles* tries to make it as easy as possible to create new adapters, and to add those adapters to your environment.

A *freckles* adapter consists of two to three files, which need to located in the same folder:

``adapter-name.freckle-adapter`` (required)
    contains metadata about the adapter. The file is yaml-formated and contains 3 main sections: ``doc`` (help text), ``role-dependencies`` (Ansible roles that this adapter needs as dependencies), and ``args`` (optional, arguments to enable additional user input client-side)
``adapter-name.freckle-init``    (optional)
    a list of tasks (in the format of an Ansible tasks file, or playbook) to execute once per run, per adapter.
``adapter-name.freckle-tasks``   (optional)
    a list of tasks (in the format of an Ansible tasks file, or playbook) to execute once for every single *freckle* in a run.

Only one of those latter two needs to exist (which one doesn't matter), but it's also possible for both of those to be there. ``freckle-init`` contains tasks that are 'adapter-specific' (tasks that need to be done the same way -- and only once -- for every *freckle* that is processed), ``freckle-tasks`` contains tasks that are 'freckle-specific' (tasks that need to be done for every *freckle*), using the *freckle* specific metadata.

As an example for a reasonably complex *adapter*, check out the source-code of the ``python-dev`` one on github: https://github.com/makkus/freckles/tree/master/freckles/external/default_adapter_repo/python-dev

Adapter folders
===============

By default *freckles* comes with a (small) set of 'officially supported' adapters which are always available (see below). In addition, by default it checks one other folder for more available adapters: ``$HOME/.freckles/adapters``. Additional locations can be specified by adding either git repository urls or local paths to the ``trusted-repos`` config option of the *freckles* config file (``$HOME/.freckles/config.yml``). To easily add and retrieve an existing git repo that contains adapters (or roles, for that matter), you can use the ``enable-repo`` *frecklecutable*, e.g.:

.. code-block:: console

   frecklecute enable-repo gh:makkus/freckles_roles_and_adapters

This will add the git repo url to the ``trusted-repos`` key in  ``$HOME/.freckles/config.yml``, and check out the repository into a location using a unique path (``$HOME/.local/freckles/repos/https/github/com/makkus/freckles/roles/and/adapters/git in this case``) where *freckles* will find it in subsequent runs.

*freckles* will look at all files in the configured folders and check if any of them contains a file that ends with the string ``.freckle-adapter``. If one (or several) is found, it'll assume the name of the adapter is the first part of the file-name (everything before ``.freckle-adapter``). Then it'll look for two other files in the same folder, starting with the (same) adapter name and ending with either ``freckle-init`` or ``freckle-tasks`` (see above).

Available adapters
==================

Supported adapters
------------------

Those are adapters that ship with the *freckles* python package.

.. toctree::
   :glob:
   :maxdepth: 1

   adapters/*

*freckles.io* adapter repository
--------------------------------

There is a repository of community created and maintained *freckle adapters*, which can easily enabled using the ``enable-repo`` *frecklecutable*:

.. code-block:: console

   frecklecutable enable-repo freckles-io

This will check out the `freckles adapters <https://github.com/freckles-io/adapters>`_ git repo (into: ``~/.local/freckles/repos/freckles_io``), and mark it as trusted in the ``~/.freckles/config.yml`` config file.

Locally available adapters
--------------------------

Which adapters are available to you locally depends on which additional repositories you specify as 'trusted' in the *freckles* config, and whether you have any custom adapters in ``~/.freckles/adapters``. To quickly list all available adapters, execute ``freckles`` with the ``--help`` option:

.. code-block:: console

   $ freckles --help
   Usage: freckles [OPTIONS] ADAPTER1 [ARGS]... [ADAPTER2 [ARGS]...]...

     Downloads a remote dataset or code (called a 'freckle') and sets up
     ...
     ...

                            * more output *

     ...
     ...
   Commands:
     debug-freckle  helper adapter, for developing other adapter
     dotfiles       installs packages, stows dotfiles
     python-dev     prepares a python development environment


Development
===========

*freckles* goal is not to manage e.g. *dotfiles* or *python development project*, but to facilitate handling a multitude of different data profiles. That's why *freckles* is designed in a way to make it easy to create new *adapters* and add them to a *freckles* execution context.

While creating *adapters* is not as easy as using them, it should still be manageable for people with a rudimentary amount of programming skills. This is mostly due to the fact that Ansible itself, on top of which *freckles* is built, has a fairly flat learning curve, esp. for a configuration management system. If you already have some experience with Ansible, writing a *freckles adapter* should be easy.
