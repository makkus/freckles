This license lets you use and share this software for free, as

4. Ensure everyone who gets a copy of this software from you, in
   source code or any other form, gets the text of this license
   and the contributor and source code lines above.

5. Do not make any legal claim against anyone for infringing any
   patent claim they would infringe by using this software alone,
   accusing this software, with or without changes, alone or as
   part of a larger application.

To contribute software, publish all its source code, in the
preferred form for making changes, through a freely accessible
distribution system widely used for similar source code, and
license contributions not already licensed to the public on terms
as permissive as this license accordingly.
