  help: |
    Ensures the parent folder of a path exists. If the ``owner`` and/or ``group`` variables is/are specified, those will be created if they don't exist yet
    and set alongside the mode for that folder.

    If the parent folder already exists, nothing will be done (no user/group created), and that folders owner, group and permissions will be left untouched.
