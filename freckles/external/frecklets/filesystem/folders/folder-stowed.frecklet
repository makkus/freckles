    Stows a folder.

    This uses the [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) application to symbolically link a folder (recursively).

    If ``target_owner`` is set, the destination folder will be changed to be owned by this user (and created with root permissions if
    it doesn't exist yet), and stow will be executed as that user.
