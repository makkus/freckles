  help: |
    Ensures a file exists, creating the necessary user and parent directories if necessary.

    If a user is created, it won't have any password set, so you might have to do that in a different (ideally earlier - to have more control) step.

    If intermediate parent directories have to be created, they will inherit the owner/group information of the file to be created. If any of those
    parent directories already exist, they won't be touched at all.
