By default the freckles configuration is locked in order to prevent users to issue potentially insecure commands
(for example by copy-and-pasting from websites).

freckles allows (if so configured), to execute scripts from remote locations. If you want to use this feature,
please check out https://freckles.io/doc/security before doing so.

It is possible (and recommended) to self-host all your remote scripts and resources, for more information visit:

https://freckles.io/docs/TODO.

There is also a repository of community-curated task-lists and resources which you can enable by default:

https://freckles.io/frecklets/community

freckles is free to be used in combination with open-source software, but needs to be licensed in order to be
used with non-free software. For more information, please check out https://freckles.io/license.
