*freckles* itself is only a framework to assemble and organize lists of tasks. In order to actually *do* anything, it relies on plugins -- so called *adapters*.

*Adapters* are basically wrappers around languages or frameworks, and they abstract those languages' instructions and augment them with metadata, so *freckles* can use them as atomic 'task' building blocks.

DOCUMENTATION STILL TO BE DONE - CHECK BACK LATER
