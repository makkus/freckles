# freckles

*Elastic & composable scripting.*


## Description

For details, visit: https://freckles.io

Although this is tagged as version 1.0.0, it should not be considered 'production-grade' code. This version is a (well-working)
proof-of-concept prototype, and I've used it without problems for the last few months, but it doesn't have (many) tests, and
the code is not as well documented as it should be. Also, even though I'm mostly happy with the overall architecture of this
version of *freckles*, there are a few pockets of complexity that I want to get rid of (as much as that will be possible)
 before I'm entirely happy.

I'm currently re-working the code (and it's dependency libraries), and the plan is for *freckles v2* to be the first
production-ready version.


# Development

Assuming you use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv) for development, here's how to setup a 'freckles' development environment manually:

    pyenv install 3.7.3
    pyenv virtualenv 3.7.3 freckles
    git clone https://gitlab.com/frkl/freckles
    cd <freckles_dir>
    pyenv local freckles
    pip install -e .[develop,testing,docs]
    pre-commit install
