*freckles* is a collection of tools designed to manage your local working environment (workstation, remote server, virtual machine, container, ...). It helps you (and your team) to apply best practices -- similar to those used in the configuration management and DevOps space, but with a slight twist -- to your development (and other) projects. And, hopefully, it saves you time while doing it.

Under heavy development
***********************

Please not, currently *freckles* is under heavy development, and the user/interface as well as install location will change until it reachers version 0.8. This means some things will break until that process is finished. I'm doing this as I don't think there are many users of *freckles* just yet. If you are one, and you have problems because of that change, contact me and I'll help you figure things out.

For documentation of the last working stable version, please refer to:
